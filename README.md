# Kotlin_android_Tutorial
Using a HeadFirst android example, I explain some of kotlin's Syntax
Am learning kotlin using the headfirst approach where you build an app and learn something in the process. This app has two buttons,clicking on
one hides the text, clicking on the other shows the text. The code was originally written in java and android studio was used to convert the code to kotlin.

So i am trying to provide an understanding of kotlin code using java's structure in relation to how this project functions.
